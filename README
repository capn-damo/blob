README

blobthemes: script to save or restore openbox gui configurations

(Requires yad, wmctrl, xdotool, xrandr, nitrogen|feh)

Save options are for  Conky(s)
                      Tint2(s)
                      Openbox theme
                      GTK theme
                      Background (uses Nitrogen or feh, depending which
                                  has the newer saved bg config file)
                      Alt Menu (dmenu)
                      Lightdm login gtk greeter

A Screenshot is saved (Windows are hidden briefly so the image
                       is the bare desktop, with any Tint2s 
                       or Conkys which are running, and a representive
                       menu open)

A time-stamped backup of rc.xml is saved "just in case". 

The dialog icon is "Bunsenlabs-flame-small.svg" - adjust the filepath
to wherever it is stored ("IMGPATH" variable)

xdotool is used to move the mouse pointer, and assumes Rclick is "click 3".
If you have the right button set to something else, then adjust the 
"MOUSECMD" variable

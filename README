blobthemes: script to save or restore openbox gui configurations

(Requires yad, wmctrl, xdotool, xrandr, nitrogen|feh)

Save options are for  Conky(s)
                      Tint2(s)
                      Openbox theme
                      GTK theme
                      Background (uses Nitrogen or feh, depending which
                                  has the newer saved bg config file)
                      Alt Menu (dmenu)
                      Lightdm login gtk greeter

Paths are assumed to be BunsenLabs defaults.

WARNING: It is assumed that the conkys are not being run via a script, so 
they will appear on all desktops. If you usually use a script, then you 
may have to make your own arrangements! Conkys in non-default directories
can be saved, but will not be seen when running bl-conkyzen.

A Screenshot is saved (Windows are hidden briefly so the image
                       is the bare desktop, with any Tint2s 
                       or Conkys which are running, and a representive
                       menu and lxappearance open)

A time-stamped backup of rc.xml is saved "just in case". 

The dialog icon is "Bunsenlabs-flame-256.svg": put it in /usr/share/pixmaps.

xdotool is used to move the mouse pointer, and assumes the root-menu is shown
with "Super + Space" keys. If you have set this to something else, then edit
the "MENUMODIFIER" variable
